# Unit-2-Challenge
Titanic Survivability Project
I created this repository for my data science prep course.  I am still a beginner at Python coding and used the Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster data set and kernals.  My code has come from Nadim Tamer and MJ Bahman.  As I get more well versed and confident with Python, I hope to revisit this project and create code myself to create a more complex narrative. Any feedback is definitely appreciated.
